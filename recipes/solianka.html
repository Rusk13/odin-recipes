            <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked diced veal</li>
            <li>1 cup diced ham</li>
            <li>¼ pound kielbasa sausage, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 quarts beef stock</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>10 black peppercorns</li>
            <li>2 dill pickles, diced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
            <li>12 marinated mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can Italian-style whole peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>12 kalamata olives</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh dill weed</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>¼ cup dill pickle juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Hungarian sweet paprika</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>    

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak mushrooms in 3/4 cup water until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt half the butter and saute the onions, meats, and rehydrated mushrooms. Add the stock and liquid from the mushrooms and bring to a boil. Make a bouquet garni by tying the bay leaves and peppercorns tightly in cheesecloth. Lower the heat and add the bouquet garni, pickles, capers, and marinated mushrooms. Simmer 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining butter in a skillet and cook the tomatoes and tomato paste for a few minutes, then add the flour and saute for another few minutes. Add a cup of the soup to the skillet and stir in well, then return pan ingredients to the soup pot.</li>
            <li>Add the olives, dill, marjoram, garlic, pickle juice, and paprika. Adjust soup's seasoning with salt and pepper; simmer another 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pot from heat and remove bouquet garni. Adjust seasonings and serve with sour cream and lemon.</li>
        </ol>
